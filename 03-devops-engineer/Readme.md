## More About Me – [Take a Look!](http://www.mjakaria.me)

## Welcome to AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional **DOP-C02**

### [DevOps Model](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)

DevOps is the combination of `cultural philosophies`, `practices`, and tools that increases an organization’s `ability to deliver applications` and services at `high velocity`: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
![DevOps Model](/img/devops.jpg)

#### How DevOps Works

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer `siloed`. Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.

These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

#### Four Pillars of DevOps

- Automation
- Quality
- Monitoring
- Testing

#### Benefits of DevOps

- Speed
- Rapid Delivery
- Reliability
- Scale
- Improved Collaboration
- Security

#### Why DevOps Matters

DevOps matters because it directly impacts how fast, reliable, and efficiently a company can deliver software and services to its customers. In today’s world, where users expect seamless digital experiences and rapid innovation, DevOps helps organizations stay competitive. Here’s why DevOps really matters:

- Faster Time to Market
- Continuous Improvement & Delivery
- Improved Collaboration
- Better Quality and Fewer Bugs
- Scalability and Flexibility
- Enhanced Security
- Cost Efficiency

In conclusion, DevOps matters for several reasons, including faster and more reliable service delivery, reduced bugs, optimized speed, and cost control across all aspects of development and operations.

#### DevOps Cultural Philosophy

DevOps is an agile approach to organizational change that seeks to bridge traditional, siloed divides between teams and establish new processes that facilitate greater collaboration. At its essence, a DevOps culture involves closer collaboration and a shared responsibility between development and operations for the products they create and maintain. This helps companies align their people, processes, and tools toward a more unified customer focus.

#### DevOps Practices

DevOps is all about the integration of development and operations through a set of best practices and principles that help streamline software development, deployment, and maintenance. These practices aim to achieve faster, more reliable, and efficient software delivery while fostering collaboration between teams. Here are some of the core DevOps practices that help organizations achieve their goals:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Microservices
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Logging
- Communication and Collaboration
- Automated Testing

#### Benefits of DevOps Culture:

- Streamlined, frequent, and high-quality software releases.
- Improved company performance and employee satisfaction.
- Fosters trust and collaboration among teams.
- Leads to better decision-making and higher job satisfaction.
- Engineers experience the reward of deploying stable, high-performing software.
- Executives benefit from improved business outcomes.

#### Challenges:

- Significant changes in workflows and buy-in at all levels (especially from leadership) are required.
- Grassroots efforts can help demonstrate success and convince executives.
- Building trust and autonomy can be difficult if there’s a history of conflict or silos.
- Clear communication of the benefits of change is necessary for acceptance.
- Tool adoption without cultural change can lead to “cargo-cult DevOps”, which focuses on the facade but ignores the core issues.

#### What is Agile?

Agile is an `iterative and incremental approach` to project management and software development that focuses on `collaboration`, `customer feedback`, and `rapid releases`. Agile is mainly about developing software in `small`, `manageable pieces` while `maintaining flexibility` and a `strong focus` on customer needs. It’s about how the team works together to build software, how they adapt to changes, and how they deliver value quickly.

![Agile Methodology](/img/agile.png)

#### Agile Manifesto?

The Agile Manifesto is a foundational document that outlines the core values and principles of the Agile methodology. The Manifesto consists of `4` key values and `12` principles that guide Agile teams in their work. As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, there are `four` main values of Agile project management.

##### `Four` pillars of Agile?

- `Individuals over processes and tools.` Agile teams value team collaboration and teamwork over working independently and doing things "by the book.”
- `Working software over comprehensive documentation.` The software that Agile teams develop should work. Additional work, like documentation, is not as important as developing good software.
- `Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.` Customers are extremely important within the Agile methodology. Agile teams allow customers to guide where the software should go. Therefore, customer collaboration is more important than the finer details of contract negotiation.
- `Responding to change over following a plan.` One of the major benefits of Agile project management is that it allows teams to be flexible. This framework allows for teams to quickly shift strategies and workflows without derailing an entire project.

##### `Twelve` Agile principles?

If the four values of the Agile model are the weight-bearing pillars of a house, then the 12 Agile principles are the rooms you can build within that house. These principles can be easily adapted to fit the needs of your software development process. The 12 principles used in Agile methodology are:

- `Satisfy customers through early, continuous improvement and delivery.` When customers receive new updates regularly, they're more likely to see the changes they want within the product. This leads to happier, more satisfied customers—and more recurring revenue.
- `Welcome changing requirements, even late in the project.` The Agile framework is all about adaptability. In iterative approaches like Agile, being inflexible causes more harm than good.
- `Deliver value frequently.` Similar to principle #1, continuous delivery of value to your customers or stakeholders frequently makes it less likely for them to churn.
- `Break the silos of your projects.` Cross-functional teams and collaboration is a key Agile value. The goal is for people to break out of their individual projects and collaborate more frequently.
- `Build projects around motivated individuals.` Agile management works best when teams are committed and actively working to achieve a goal.
- `The most effective way to communicate is face-to-face.` If you’re working on a distributed team, spend time communicating in ways that involve face-to-face communication like Zoom calls or daily stand-up meetings.
- `Working software is the primary measure of progress.` The ultimate goal of software development projects is a working product, and the Agile framework supports this by prioritizing functional software above all.
- `Maintain a sustainable working pace.` Some aspects of Agile project management can be fast-paced, but it shouldn't be so fast that team members burn out. The goal is to maintain sustainability throughout the development process.
- `Continuous excellence enhances agility.` If the team develops excellent code in one sprint, they can continue to build off of it the next. Continually creating great work allows teams to move faster in the future.
- `Simplicity is essential.` Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Agile development aims to not over complicate things and find simple answers to complex problems.
- `Self-organizing teams generate the most value.` Similar to principle #5, proactive teams become valuable assets to the company as they strive to deliver continuous improvement.
- `Regularly reflect and adjust your way of work to improve effectiveness.` Retrospective meetings are a common Agile practice. It's a dedicated time for Agile teams to look back and reflect on their performance and adapt their behaviors for the future.

##### Agile Methodologies

There are several frameworks and methodologies under Agile, including:

- `Scrum` - It's a common Agile methodology for small teams and also involves sprints. The team is led by a Scrum master whose main job is to clear all obstacles for others executing the day-to-day work.
- `Kanban` - It's a visual approach to Agile. Teams use online Kanban board tools to represent where certain tasks are in the development process. Tasks are represented by cards on a board, and stages are represented in columns.
- `Extreme Programming (XP)` - Typically used in software development, Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile framework that outlines values that will allow your team to work together more effectively.
- `Lean` - It's  is a way of optimizing organizational processes to maximize customer value while minimizing waste and resources. It emphasizes continuous improvement and the efficient use of resources to streamline processes, reduce costs, and increase quality.
- `Adaptive Project Framework (APF)`- It's also known as Adaptive Project Management (APM) grew from the idea that unknown factors can show up at any time during a project.
- `Feature-Driven Development (FDD)` - Feature Driven Development blends different Agile best practices. While still an iterative method of project management, this model focuses more on the exact features of a software that the team is working to develop.
- `Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)` - It's is an Agile method that focuses on a full project lifecycle. Because of this, DSDM has a more rigorous structure and foundation, unlike other Agile methods.
- `Extreme Project Management (XPM)` - This type of project management is often used for very complex projects with a high level of uncertainty. This approach involves constantly adapting processes until they lead to the desired result.

### Scrum Cheat Sheet

#### Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework where work is delivered in short, time-boxed iterations and Sprints. Each Sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and continuously improve. The Agile process generally follows a cyclical flow where the team iterates through the same process repeatedly to improve and deliver value.

![Agile Process Flow/Workflow](/img/agile-framework.jpg)

#### Agile Process Flow/Workflow

- `Backlog:` This is a list of tasks and user stories that need to be completed.
- `Sprint Planning:` The team picks which user stories to work on for the upcoming sprint.
- `Daily Standups:` A short meeting to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
- `Sprint Review:` At the end of a sprint, the team demonstrates the work completed.
- `Sprint Retrospective:` The team reviews what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.

#### Tools for Agile

Some of the tools commonly used to manage Agile projects include:

- Jira
- Trello
- Asana
- Monday.com
- VersionOne
- ClickUp

#### ROLES IN SCRUM

##### Product Owner (PO)

- Represents the voice of the customer.
- Manages and prioritizes the Product Backlog.
- Ensures the team builds the right product.
- **Core Responsibility:** Communication and Value Maximization

##### Scrum Master (SM)

- Servant-leader and facilitator for the team.
- Ensures Scrum principles are followed.
- Removes impediments and shields the team from distractions.
- **Core Responsibility:** Scrum implementation and process improvement

##### The Team (DevOps/Development/DBA/QAE)

- Self-organizing, cross-functional group (3–9 members).
- Responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments every Sprint.
- **Core Responsibility:** Delivering high-quality work

#### ITERATIONS (SPRINTS)

- Sprints are time-boxed iterations where a fixed scope of work is executed.
- **Typical Length:** 1–4 weeks
- Once a Sprint starts, the scope is **locked**; new tasks cannot be added.
- **Outcome:** A working product increment that could be released.

#### ESTIMATION

Estimation helps teams plan and forecast future work.
Can be done in:

- **Hours** – Used for precise task duration
- **Story Points** – Abstract measure based on complexity, risk, and effort
- Done during backlog refinement or Sprint Planning

#### SCOPE LIMITS

- The Sprint scope is limited to the team’s capacity.
- Over committing or introducing new work mid-Sprint is discouraged.
- Focus is on maintaining sustainable pace and delivery quality.

#### SCRUM EVENTS / MEETINGS

##### Sprint Planning

- Held at the start of a Sprint (usually 1–2 hours per week of Sprint length).
- The team and PO agree on the Sprint Goal and the work needed to achieve it.

##### Daily Scrum (Stand-up)

- 15-minute daily sync to inspect progress and adapt the plan.
- Team members answer:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What will I do today?
  - Are there any impediments?

##### Sprint Review

- Held at the end of the Sprint.
- The team demos the increment to stakeholders and collects feedback.
- Helps guide future backlog items.

##### Sprint Retrospective

- Held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.
- Focuses on **process improvement**.
- Discusses:
  - What went well?
  - What didn’t?
  - What can be improved?

#### PRIORITIZATION

Managed by the **Product Owner**.
Items in the Product Backlog are ordered based on:

- Customer value
- Risk/complexity
- Dependencies
- Time sensitivity
- Helps the team stay focused on high-impact work.

#### BOARD (TASK TRACKING)

A typical Scrum board has four key sections:

1. **Product Backlog** – All features, fixes, and requirements (not yet selected for Sprint).
2. **Sprint Backlog** – Work selected for the current Sprint.
3. **Doing** – Tasks currently in progress.
4. **Done** – Completed tasks or stories.

Boards can be:

- Physical (whiteboards with sticky notes)
- Digital (e.g., Jira, Trello, Azure Boards)

#### KEY SCRUM TERMS

##### Product Backlog

A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes maintained by the PO.

##### Sprint Backlog

A subset of the Product Backlog selected for a Sprint, broken into tasks by the team.

##### Story Point

A relative unit for estimating effort, used instead of hours to avoid bias and promote velocity tracking.

##### User Story

A short description of functionality from the user's perspective:
"As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."

##### Burndown Chart

A visual tool showing remaining work in the Sprint over time.
Helps track progress and identify bottlenecks.

##### Team Velocity

The average number of story points a team can complete in a Sprint.
Useful for forecasting future Sprints.

#### Comparison between DevOps and Agile in terms of their key aspects:

![Comparison between DevOps and Agile](/img/devops-agile.png)

#### [SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sdlc/)

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.

![Software Development Lifecycle](/img/sdlc.png)

### SDLC important?

Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.

**Here are some benefits of SDLC:**

- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
- Improved risk management and cost estimation
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction

#### How does SDLC work?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software. The details of the SDLC process vary for different teams. However, we outline some common SDLC phases below.

1. `Plan`- Establish project goals, conduct cost-benefit analysis, and gather requirements from stakeholders. Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document to guide the project.
2. `Design`- Analyze requirements and decide on technology, architecture, and integration with existing systems. Plan the system’s structure and user interface.
3. `Implement`- Develop the software by coding it in incremental tasks. Use version control and perform code reviews to ensure quality.
4. `Test`- Conduct automated and manual tests to identify bugs and ensure the software meets the requirements. Testing often overlaps with development.
5. `Deploy`- Move the software from a test environment to production, ensuring a smooth transition without disrupting user access.
6. `Maintain`- Fix bugs, update software, and monitor performance to ensure ongoing stability, security, and user satisfaction.

#### What are SDLC models?

A software development lifecycle (SDLC) model conceptually presents SDLC in an organized fashion to help organizations implement it. Different models arrange the SDLC phases in varying chronological order to optimize the development cycle. We look at some popular SDLC models below.

1. Waterfall
The waterfall model arranges all the phases sequentially so that each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase. Conceptually, the design flows from one phase down to the next, like that of a waterfall.

| **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provides discipline to project management.        | Little room for changes once a phase is complete.                                                 |
| Tangible output at the end of each phase.         | Changes can affect delivery time, cost, and quality.                                              |
| Suitable for small software development projects. | Not flexible for larger, more complex projects with evolving requirements.                        |
| Tasks are easy to arrange and manage.             | Requires accurate pre-definition of requirements, which can be difficult in dynamic environments. |

2. Iterative
The iterative process suggests that teams begin software development with a small subset of requirements. Then, they iteratively enhance versions over time until the complete software is ready for production. The team produces a new software version at the end of each iteration.

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to identify and manage risks.          | Repeated cycles could lead to scope changes. |
| Requirements can change between iterations. | Can result in underestimation of resources.  |

3. Spiral
The spiral model combines the iterative model's small repeated cycles with the waterfall model's linear sequential flow to prioritize risk analysis. You can use the spiral model to ensure software's gradual release and improvement by building prototypes at each phase.

| **Pros**                                                | **Cons**                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suitable for large and complex projects.                | Can be expensive for smaller projects with a limited scope. |
| Well-suited for projects that require frequent changes. |                                                             |

4. Agile
The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles. The team iterates through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle. They continuously evaluate requirements, plans, and results so that they can respond quickly to change. The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it more efficient than other process models.

| **Pros**                                                         | **Cons**                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rapid development cycles help identify and address issues early. | Overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope changes. |
| Allows engagement with customers and stakeholders for feedback.  | Could result in the project being ended midway or altered excessively.   |

#### [Continuos Integration/Continuos Development (CI/CD)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cicd_for_5g_networks_on_aws/cicd-on-aws.html)

It's a software development practice aimed at improving the quality and speed of software delivery. CI/CD pipelines are often implemented using various tools and technologies such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others. These tools automate the stages of building, testing, and deployment, enabling development teams to release software more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. We could complete the CI/CD in seven steps (technology stack).

#### Monitoring Tools (Events, Webhooks & Polling)

- Events:
  You can monitor CodePipeline events in EventBridge, which delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Notification Service. These events are the same as those that appear in Amazon CloudWatch Events, which delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources.
  - Event Pattern
     Each rule is expressed as an event pattern with the source and type of events to monitor, and event targets. To monitor events, you create a rule with the service you are monitoring as the event source, such as CodePipeline. For example, you can create a rule with an event pattern that uses CodePipeline as an event source to trigger the rule when there are changes in the state of a pipeline, stage, or action.
  - Targets
     The new rule receives a selected service as the event target. You might want to set up a target service to send notifications, capture state information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions. When you add your target, you must also grant permissions to EventBridge to allow it to invoke the selected target service.
- Polling:
 It is when your application periodically requests updates from the server. Polling is a simple way to receive updates from a remote server. Your application sends a request to the server at regular intervals, and the server will respond with any updates that have occurred since the last request. Polling is easy to implement and can be a good choice for applications that don't need to receive updates very frequently. However, polling can be inefficient if your application needs to receive updates very quickly, or if the server is slow to respond.

  ![Polling](/img/polling.jpg)

- Webhooks:
  Webhooks are when the server sends updates to your application as they happen. Webhooks are a more efficient way to receive updates from a remote server. When you register a webhook with a server, the server will send an HTTP POST request to your application's URL whenever an event occurs. This means that your application will only receive updates when they happen, which can save bandwidth and improve performance. Webhooks are more complex to implement than polling, but they are a good choice for applications that need to receive updates very quickly, or if the server is slow to respond.

>**NB:** Events are the default & recommended.
